# Modoc

- Designed with the use of tables and blocks in mind. 
- When you need to optimize screen real estate utilization.
- *__Modoc is an excellent Admin Theme.__*

## Documentation

Full documentation will be developed as time and resources permit. You may also visit our wiki at https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/modoc/wiki
Meanwhile, here are some tips:
- Particularly useful for side menus and blocks: you may add the css class 'hide-overflow' to any block through the UI (see below). this will truncate the contents rather than having them bleed into the body of the next layout column to the right.
- The easiest way to get rid of all the block borders is to set the block border color the same as the page background color.
- The default block border width is one pixel. To change that, you may add the following css classes to any block through the admin UI (Configure Block | Style Settings | Style:Default -> Additional CSS Classes):
  - 'border-0' (no border)
  - 'border-2' (2px)
  - 'border-3' (3px...)
  - 'border-5'
  - 'border-7'
  - 'border-10' (10px)
  - combine any of the above with 'hide-overflow' (separated by a space)
- The logo image is not scaled in css, thus it must be pre-scaled prior to uploading. I have found an image height of 75 to 125 pixels to work well. Here's my favorite resizing tool: https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png

## Caveats

- For vertical menus, be sure to set the Menu Style to 'Dropdown Menu' in order to make them look good. More work on this is pending.
- More testing is required to make sure that menus work in every layout implementation, etc.
### To-Do
- Add a box and button corner radius selection, for more styling options.
- Implement color gradients for buttons and block backgrounds.
- Continue the never-ending process of refining and cleaning up the css.
- etc.
